Originally an assignment for Cloud Computing

Locomotion is a service for gamers looking for information on steam games. Users can view information on steam games that they play already or look for new games to play by looking at what their friends have been playing recently. Useful information for hardcore gamers like recent news regarding games is displayed as well as the users achievement progress compared to rest of the community. Any statistical information like achievement progress will be presented to the user with easy to read charts and graphs.

On top of this Locomotion will also display information about twitch streamers that are currently streaming the particular game that the user is looking at.
